# EDA MCP Aggregation Website Project Plan

## 1. Project Setup

*   Create a new directory named `mcp4eda` next to the `anysilicon` directory.
*   Initialize a new Node.js project within the `mcp4eda` directory.
*   Install necessary dependencies, such as Express.js for the web framework.

## 2. Core Aggregator Logic (Inspired by `mcp-proxy-server`)

*   Create a configuration file (e.g., `mcp-servers.json`) to list the EDA-related MCP servers to be aggregated. This file will contain information about each server, such as its name, URL, and the tools it provides.
*   Implement a proxy server that reads the configuration file and dynamically creates routes for each MCP server.
*   The proxy will forward requests to the appropriate MCP server and return the response to the client.

## 3. Frontend Website

*   Create a simple frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) to display the available MCP servers and their tools.
*   The frontend will fetch the list of servers and tools from our aggregator's API.
*   The UI will be designed to be clear and intuitive for EDA engineers, with a focus on tool discoverability. I will categorize tools based on EDA domains (e.g., Simulation, Verification, Physical Design).

## 4. Optimization and EDA-Specific Features

*   **Caching:** Implement caching for MCP server responses to improve performance.
*   **Tool Discovery:** Add a search functionality to easily find specific tools across all aggregated servers.
*   **Documentation:** For each tool, provide a link to its documentation or a brief description of its functionality.
*   **UI/UX:** The UI will be tailored for EDA users, potentially including features like:
    *   Tagging/labeling of tools.
    *   Filtering by EDA category.
    *   A "favorites" or "most used" section.
