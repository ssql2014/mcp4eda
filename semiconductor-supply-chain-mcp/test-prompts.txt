1. Basic tool discovery:
"What tools are available in the semiconductor supply chain MCP?"

2. Find IP vendors:
"Find me DDR5 PHY IP vendors that support 7nm process technology"

3. Find ASIC services:
"I need ASIC design services for a 7nm chip. What providers are available?"

4. Price estimation:
"What would be the estimated NRE cost for a high-complexity ASIC in 7nm technology?"

5. Vendor comparison:
"Compare Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens for PHY IP offerings"

6. Natural language query:
"Help me find three vendors that can provide low-power DDR5 PHY IP for TSMC 28nm process"

7. Complex request:
"I'm designing a networking chip and need:
- 100G Ethernet PHY IP
- PCIe Gen5 controller
- DDR5 memory interface
Find suitable vendors and estimate the total IP licensing cost"
